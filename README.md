# MinesweeperJS
This is an implementation of the classic game [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To run the game you will need [NodeJS](nodejs.org) installed. Then run ´node create_highscores.js´ to create the file which contains the highscores and ´node server.js´ to start the server.
